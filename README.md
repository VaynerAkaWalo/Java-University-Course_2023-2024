## Java university course 2023/2024
The repository contains solutions and unit tests for assignments required to pass a university Java course.
Solutions to assignments will be added to the repository only after the course is completed to prevent plagiarism. 
However, tests written by me will be made available on an ongoing basis, which will allow other course participants to create their own solutions more easily.

### Disclaimer
>The tests provided by me should be a solid base for creating your own task solutions, but I do not guarantee that a program passing all my tests will pass all the tests of the course instructor.

### Prerequisites
Before you start make sure you have the following:

    Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 17 or higher)  
    Maven

### How to use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VaynerAkaWalo/Java-University-Course_2023-2024.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the appropriate module e.g. for first task it will be:
   ```bash
   cd Java-University_Course_2023-2024/Assignment_01/
   ```
   
3. Write your task solution under src/main/java  


4. When you want to test your solution open a terminal in the main folder of the module (e.g. for first task it will be Assignment_01) and execute command:
